Over- and under-performance in Formula 1: The role of starting grid and race context (2021–2023)

The goal of this project is to develop a supervised model that predicts whether a Formula 1 driver overperforms or underperforms relative to their starting grid position. Instead of only analyzing correlations, the goal is to train a model that classifies drivers’ performance outcomes based on several race-related variables.
“The target variable is binary (1 = overperformer, 0 = underperformer). The input features include starting grid position, team affiliation, and other selected race context variables. The data will mainly come from the Kaggle Formula 1 dataset for the 2021-2023 seasons.

With this topic, I will be able to use classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Their performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision and recall, with a feature importance analysis to identify which variables most strongly influence overperformance.

This proposal reflects the initial design of the project. As the project evolved, certain methodological choices and feature selections were refined, meaning that some elements of the proposal are no longer fully representative of the final implementation.
